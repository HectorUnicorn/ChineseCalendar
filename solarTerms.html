<h1>24 Solar Terms (&#20108; &#21313; &#22235; &#31680; &#27683;)</h1>

<br />    
<p>As seen on Earth, the Sun moves eastward relative to stars in the celestial sphere with a period of one year. The path of the Sun on the celestial sphere is a great circle and is called the <i>ecliptic</i>. This is Earth's orbital plane projected onto the celestial sphere. In the past, Chinese astronomers determined the position of the Sun in the ecliptic using a <a href="http://hua.umf.maine.edu/China/astronomy/tianpage/0022MingGnomon6471w.html" target="_blank">gnomon</a>. It measures the length of the shadow of an upright pole cast by the Sun at solar noon. Here solar noon means the time of a day when the Sun is due south (at locations north of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropic_of_Cancer" target="_blank">tropic of Cancer</a>). The day at which the shadow at solar noon is the longest is called <i>d&#333;ngzh&#236;</i>, or winter solstice. The period between two successive winter solstices is called a <i>su&#236;</i>, whereas the period between two successive Chinese New Year days is called a <i>ni&#225;n</i>. Today, <i>su&#236;</i> is rarely used to measure time, except when talking about a person's age, and <i>ni&#225;n</i> generally refers to a year in Gregorian calendar.</p>
    
<p>Starting from winter solstice, the ecliptic can be divided into 24 uniformly-spaced sections. There are 24 boundary points separating the 24 sections. The times of the 24 solar terms are defined to be the times when the Sun reaches these 24 points on the ecliptic. The 24 solar terms are thus generalizations of the equinoxes and solstices, which divide the ecliptic into four sections. We now know that the apparent motion of the Sun is caused by Earth's orbital motion around the Sun. So we can think of the 24 solar terms as the times when the Earth passes 24 points in its orbit, as shown in the figure below. Note that Earth's spin axis is not perpendicular to its orbital plane. It is this tilt that causes <a href="https://spaceplace.nasa.gov/seasons/en/" target="_blank">seasons</a> and the varying shadow lengths at solar noons over the course of a year.</p>

<p>In modern astronomical parlance, the 24 solar terms are defined as the times when the apparent geocentric ecliptic longitude of the Sun, <span class="greek">&lambda;</span><sub>s</sub>, reaches integral multiples of 15&deg;. Starting from winter solstice, the odd-numbered solar terms are called the <i>major</i> solar terms (<i>zh&#333;ngq&#236;</i> &#20013;&#27683;), and the even-numbered solar terms are called <i>minor</i> solar terms (<i>ji&#233;q&#236;</i> &#31680;&#27683;). The following table lists the 24 solar terms, the English translation of their names and the Sun's apparent geocentric longitude. A major solar term is labelled by Z followed by a number, and a minor solar term is labelled by J followed by a number. This labelling is adopted from Aslaksen's article <a href="http://www.math.nus.edu.sg/aslaksen/calendar/cal.pdf" target="_blank">The Mathematics of the Chinese Calendar</a> and Section 15.8.3 of the book <a href="http://www.uscibooks.com/urban.htm" target="_blank"><i>Explanatory Supplement
to the Astronomical Almanac</i></a> (third edition).</p>

<p>Note that the 24 solar terms are based on the position of the Sun only. Gregorian calendar is also arranged based on the Sun's position. As a result, the Gregorian dates of the 24 solar terms are almost the same every year, give or take one or two days. In the past, dates of 24 solar terms were published every year in the Chinese calendar. Many people therefore  think that 24 solar terms are related to lunar calendar, which is wrong. The 24 solar terms are used to insert leap (intercalary) months in the Chinese calendar to keep it in sync with seasons, as explained in the <a href="rules.html">Chinese Calendar Rules</a> page.</p>
