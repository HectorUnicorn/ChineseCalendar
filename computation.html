<h1>Calendar Calculation on This Website</h1>
<p>First draft: October 2018 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last major update: June 29, 2019</p>
<br />
 
<p>The time span of calendars on this website is from 722 B.C. to 2200 A.D. It can be divided into six periods: modern period (1912&ndash;2200), Qing period (1645 &ndash; 1911), middle Han to Ming period (104 B.C.&ndash;1644 A.D.), Qin and Early Han period (221 B.C.&ndash;104 B.C.), Warring States period (480 B.C.&ndash;222 B.C.), Spring and Autumn period (722 B.C.&ndash;481 B.C.). Different methods are used to generate calendars in these periods, which are described in the following sections.</p>
    
<p>For convenience, I use <span class="nowrap">N<sub>y</sub></span> to denote the Chinese year whose New Year day is closest to Jan. 1 in the Western year y. For example, <span class="nowrap">N<sub>1095</sub></span> began on Feb. 8, 1095 and ended on Jan. 27, 1096.</p>

<h2 class="subsec" id="modern">Modern Period (1912 &ndash; 2200)</h2>
    
<p>In this period, I follow the rules stated by the GB/T 33661-2017 document<sup><a href="#GBT33661">PMO17</a></sup> mentioned in the <a href="rules.html">Chinese calendar rules page</a> to calculate the Chinese calendar and checked the results with the calendar data from the publications of the Purple Mountain Observatory. Positions of the Sun and Moon are computed based on the planetary and lunar ephemeris DE431<sup><a href="#DE">DE</a></sup> developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). JPL's DE-series ephemerides are based on numerical integration and DE431 is one of the most accurate ephemerides covering long time span. The calculation takes into account gravitational perturbations from 343 relatively large-mass asteroids. General relativistic effects are included by using dynamical equations derived from a parametrized post-Newtonian n-body metric. Additional accelerations arising from non-spherical effects of extended bodies including the Earth, Moon and Sun are also included. The DE431 ephemeris data are used to compute the geometric positions of the Sun and Moon, which are then corrected for the combined effect of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-time_correction" target="_blank">light time</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aberration_of_light" target="_blank">aberration of light</a>. The result is the apparent geocentric positions expressed in rectangular coordinates in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Celestial_Reference_System" target="_blank">International Celestial Reference System</a> (ICRS). They are then transformed to the ecliptic coordinates of date by taking into account the frame bias matrix, precession and nutation. Precession is calculated using the precession model of Vondr&#225;k et. al.<sup><a href="#vondrak11">Vondr&#225;k</a></sup> developed in 2011. Nutation is calculated by the IAU 2000A nutation model using formulas provided by IERS Conventions (2010)<sup><a href="#iers2010">IERS10</a></sup> and Kaplan 2005<sup><a href="#kaplan05">Kaplan05</a></sup>. Times of moon phases and 24 solar terms are first computed in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barycentric_Dynamical_Time" target="_blank">barycentric dynamical time</a> (TDB) using the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method" target="_blank">Newton-Raphson root-finding method</a>. They are then converted to UT1+8 for years before 1972 and UTC+8 in and after 1972. The difference between TDB and TT (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terrestrial_Time" target="_blank">Terrestrial Time</a>) is ignored since it is less than two milliseconds over several millennia. For years before 1972, values of TT-UT1 are calculated using the analytic fitting formula by <a href="https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEcat5/deltatpoly.html" target="_blank">Espenak and Meeus</a>. For years between 1972 and present, TT-UTC is calculated from the published leap seconds. For years beyond 2020, approximate value of TT-UTC is estimated according to the polynomial expressions by <a href="https://eclipse.gsfc.nasa.gov/SEcat5/deltatpoly.html" target="_blank">Espenak and Meeus</a>. The expressions are for TT-UT1, but can be used to approximate TT-UTC since by construction |UTC-UT1| &lt; 0.9 seconds. The mathematical detail of all these calculations is explained in <a href="docs/sunMoon.pdf" target="_blank">this pdf file</a>.</p>
    
<p>Previously, I used the IAU 2006 precession model to calculate precession for this website, but the IAU 2006 model is only accurate within about 1000 years from the year 2000. This website only covered 1841 &ndash; 2200 and so it was fine, but now the time span is extended to 722 B.C. &ndash; 2200. Even though the past Chinese calendar on this website is based on the calendar issued at that time, times of moon phases and 24 solar terms in UT1+8 calculated using the modern method are also included for reference. Thus, the IAU 2006 model is inadequate for the years before 1000 A.D. The Vondr&#225;k et. al. model is an improvement over IAU 2006 and is valid within 200,000 years from 2000. I compare the times of moon phases and solar terms computed by these two precession models. I find that between 1600 and 2500 the time differences of the solar terms are no more than 0.19 seconds and the time differences of the moon phases are no more than 0.00038 seconds. Hence, we can regard the two precession models as identical in this period.</p>
    
<p>The calendar data in this period are compared with those in the book <i>New Edition of W&#224;nni&#225;nl&#236;</i><sup><a href="#pmo86">PMO86</a></sup> edited by the Purple Mountain Observatory and in the book <i>Pocket Edition of 100-Year Chinese Calendar</i><sup><a href="#liu93">Liu93</a></sup> edited by Li&#250; B&#462;ol&#237;n, who had been involved in the Chinese calendar calculation in the Purple Mountain Observatory for over 40 years. The time span of <i>New Edition of W&#224;nni&#225;nl&#236;</i> is from 1840 to 2050, whereas the time span of Li&#250;'s book is from 1911 to 2010. The data in these two books agree, but Li&#250;'s book also provides the times of new moons, full moons and 24 solar terms to the nearest minute. In the books, the calendar data before 1949 were taken from the calendars issued by the Chinese government at that time. In particular, calendar data before 1912 were taken from the <i>Sh&#237;xi&#224;n Calendar</i> published by the Qing dynasty government. Data from 1912 to 1928 were taken from <i>Republic of China Calendar</i> published by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beiyang_government" target="_blank">Beiyang government</a> of the Republic of China. Data from 1929 to 1948 were based on the <i>Ku&#243;m&#237;n Calendar</i><sup>[<a href="#kuomin">fn1</a>]</sup> published by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nationalist_government" target="_blank">Nationalist government</a> of the Republic of China. Data after 1948 are calculated by the Purple Mountain Observatory, which has been responsible for computing the calendar since 1949. Whenever there is a discrepancy between my calculation and the data in the books on the start day of a Chinese month, I use the data in the books on this website. There are only three discrepancies and they all occurred before 1929. In addition to the discrepancies in the dates of lunar conjunctions, there are also discrepancies in the dates of 24 solar terms. With one exception, all the discrepancies occurred before 1929. The following two tables list all the discrepancies between 1912 and 2050.</p>

<br /> 
<p>The discrepancies before 1914 are mainly caused by the fact that the calendar at that time was calculated based on a method developed in 1742. While the method was pretty good at the time (see the next section), it is not accurate by today's standard. A more accurate method was adopted in the calendar calculation after 1913, but times were still calculated for the Beijing meridian, which was about 14 minutes earlier than the times for the meridians of 120&deg;E. This explains the discrepancies in the years 1914, 1916, 1917, 1920, 1927 and 1928. The case in 1979 is special. My calculation indicates that the time of Z12 was only 6 seconds before Jan. 21. This means that highly accurate ephemerides are required to pinpoint the exact date. Prior to 1984, positions of the Sun in most published annual astronomical almanacs (including the <i>Chinese Astronomical Almanac</i> edited by the PMO) were calculated based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newcomb%27s_Tables_of_the_Sun" target="_blank">Newcomb's <i>Tables of the Sun</i></a>, which were developed in 1895 and were accurate to about 1". It is possible that the calendar calculation at that time was based on an ephemeris of similar precision. If so, the times of 24 solar terms could be off by about 25 seconds. By comparing the times of the 24 solar terms in Li&#250;'s book<sup><a href="#liu93">Liu93</a></sup> (printed to the nearest minute) and my calculation, I find deviations of one minute occurring very frequently. No such deviations are found for the times of 24 solar terms listed on the Hong Kong Observatory's <a href="http://www.hko.gov.hk/gts/astron2018/Solar_Term_2018_e.htm" target="_blank">24 solar terms date and time page</a>. This is not surprising since the times there are computed from astronomical data provided by the <i>HM Nautical Almanac Office</i>, and Nautical Almanac's data have been computed from JPL's DE430 ephemeris since 2015. There is only a very slight difference between DE430 and DE431 used on this website within a few hundred years from 2000. In any case, none of the discrepancies listed in the table affects the days and months of the Chinese calendar.</p>
    
<p>As mentioned in the <a href="rules.html#newStandard">Chinese calendar rules page</a>, times (in UTC+8) of lunar conjunctions and 24 solar terms decades from now cannot be determined very accurately. In situations when the times are close to midnight, the actual dates of lunar conjunctions and solar terms may be off by one day. These situations are indicated on the relevant calendar pages. When a lunar conjunction occurs near the midnight, the predicted first day of a month may be off by one day. These cases occur on September 29, 2057; September 4, 2089; August 7, 2097; September 28, 2133; October 17, 2172 and May 12, 2192. When a major solar term occurs near the midnight, most of the time there will be no effect on the Chinese calendar. However, if a new moon also occurs within a day from the date of the major solar term, the off-by-one-day-error could result in a different leap month. I have checked that this does not happen over the time span covered on this website. The following table lists the  lunar conjunctions and solar terms from 2051&ndash;2200 that are predicted to occur close to midnight, and therefore may be off by one day.</p>

<h2 class="subsec" id="qing">The Qing Period (1645 &ndash; 1911)</h2>
    
<p>The rules for the calendar calculation in this period is basically the same as the modern rules. The only difference is that times were computed for the Beijing meridian instead of 120&deg;E (UT1+8), and apparent solar time was used instead of the mean solar time. To reconstruct the calendar in this period, I first used the modern method to calculate the calendar and then modified the data to match the calendar issued by the Qing government. The source of the Qing calendar data are from the book <i>New Edition of W&#224;nni&#225;nl&#236;</i><sup><a href="#pmo86">PMO86</a></sup> and <i>3500 Calendars and Astronomical Phenomena</i><sup><a href="#Zhang1997">Zhang97</a></sup>. Calendar data in <i>New Edition of W&#224;nni&#225;nl&#236;</i> were taken from the <i>Sh&#237;xi&#224;n Calendar</i> issued by the Qing government, but the book only covered the years starting from 1840. Calendar data in <i>3500 Calendars and Astronomical Phenomena</i> were computed using the calendar rules stated in the historical documents and were compared to available calendar data. Almost all of the calendars issued by the government over the past 400 years or so have been preserved and so the data in the book should be exactly the same as the actual calendar used in this period. I compared the data in the two books between 1840 and 1911 and didn't find any mismatch.</p> 
    
<p>When comparing the calendar data calculated by the modern method and the official calendar data, I find more than 200 mismatches in this period. Even though I had to make more than 200 corrections, it was still faster than entering the data by hand. All the discrepancies are listed on <a href="discrepanciesQing.html">this page</a>. Apart from the time difference between the local apparent solar time and UT1+8, the cause of the discrepancies was largely due to the inaccuracy of the methods adopted by astronomers in the Imperial Astronomical Bureau (&#27453;&#22825;&#30435;) to calculate the positions of the Sun and Moon.</p>
    
<p>The astronomical method used in the almanac calculation before 1730s was developed near the end of the Ming dynasty around 1635 and was based on the geoheliocentric model of Tycho Brahe. In the 17th century, the predicted times of two solar eclipses and one lunar eclipse were significantly different from the actual times. In 1630, Emperor Ch&#243;ngzh&#275;n (&#23815;&#31118;) appointed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xu_Guangqi" target="_blank">X&#250; Gu&#257;ngq&#464;</a> (&#24464;&#20809;&#21855;) to organize a committee to improve the almanac. X&#250;, a Catholic convert, was impressed by an eclipse prediction on Dec. 15, 1610 by the Italian Jesuit Matteo Ricci. He decided to develop an astronomical system based on the Western astronomy introduced by the Jesuits. The Jesuits Nicholas Longobardi, Johann Schreck, Giacomo Rho and Johann Adam Schall von Bell were appointed to the committee to help to develop a new almanac. In 1635, <i>Ch&#243;ngzh&#275;n L&#236;sh&#363;</i> (&#12298;&#23815;&#31118;&#26310;&#26360;&#12299; or <i>Ch&#243;ngzh&#275;n Almanac</i>) was compiled, introducing the new system. The calendar based on this system was not adopted because of the opposition of the conservatives. Eight contests between the old and new almanacs were recorded to have been taken place in 10 years, involving predictions of eclipses and motions of Jupiter, Mercury and Mars. The emperor realized the superiority of the new almanac and decided to adopt it. However, the Ming dynasty collapsed before the adoption was officially announced.</p>
    
<p>In 1644, the Qing government took over Beijing. The Prince-Regent <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dorgon" target="_blank">Dorgon</a> heard of the superiority of the new almanac. Johann Adam Schall von Bell was asked to explain the new almanac. It was soon decided that the new almanac would be used to calculate the calendar. Schall von Bell shortened the <i>Ch&#243;ngzh&#275;n Almanac</i> and renamed it as <i>X&#299;y&#225;ng X&#299;nf&#462; L&#236;sh&#363;</i> (&#12298;&#35199;&#27915;&#26032;&#27861;&#26310;&#26360;&#12299;, roughly translated to <i>Almanac Based on the New Theory from the West</i>). The first calendar calculated by the new almanac, the <i>Sh&#237;xi&#224;n Calendar</i> (&#26178;&#25010;&#26310;), was issued in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>1645</sub></span>. The new almanac abandoned the <i>p&#237;nq&#236;</i> rule (based on the mean motion of the Sun), which had been used for over 2000 years, in favor of the <i>d&#237;nq&#236;</i> rule (based on the motion of the true Sun) in the calculation of the 24 solar terms. Positions of the Sun, Moon and planets were computed using Tycho's geoheliocentric model. Tycho's hybrid model was never popular in the West, and it was not the most accurate model at that time.</p>
    
<p>There were mismatches between figures and tables in <i>Almanac Based on the New Theory from the West</i>. There were also many places where the texts were hard to understand. In 1714, astronomers in the Imperial Astronomical Bureau were asked to revise the document. The book <i>L&#236;xi&#224;ng K&#462;och&#233;ng</i> (&#12298;&#26310;&#35937;&#32771;&#25104;&#12299;, roughly translated to <i>Explanation of the Almanac Calculations</i>) was compiled in 1722. The astronomical theory was still based on Tycho's model. Not only was the model outdated, but also the errors accumulated over time. In the observation of the solar eclipse on July 15, 1730, there was a slight discrepancy between the prediction and observation. The Jesuit missionaries Ignatius K&#246;gler and Andreas Pereira, who were in charge of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau, were asked to revise the almanac. They used the method and data from the French astronomer Giovanni Cassini to create tables for the motions of the Sun and Moon.</p>

<p>The Jesuits inserted the new tables to the end of the book <i>Explanation of the Almanac Calculations</i> without any documentation. Only a few people in the Imperial Astronomical Bureau knew how to use them. This was very unusual. As a result, the government asked for a major revision of the documentation and published <i>L&#236;xi&#224;ng K&#462;och&#233;ng H&#242;ubi&#257;n</i>(&#12298;&#26310;&#35937;&#32771;&#25104;&#24460;&#32232;&#12299;, roughly translated to <i>Supplement to the Explanation of the Almanac Calculations</i>) in 1742. In the document, Kepler's laws of motion are introduced, but the Sun is described to move on an elliptical orbit around the Earth with the Earth fixed on one focus of the ellipse. In terms of practical calculation, the result is identical to Kepler's heliocentric model.</p>
    
<p>There were many discrepancies between the dates of the 24 solar terms calculated using the modern method and Tycho's model. Therefore, the calendrical solar terms, the solar terms calculated using the almanac at that time, are listed on our <a href="index.html">calendar webpage</a> together with the solar terms calculated using the modern method. When the calculation was switched to using Kepler's laws, the discrepancies were greatly reduced. So after 1733, the dates of the calendrical solar terms were mostly the same as the dates calculated using the modern method and therefore they are omitted, except when there were discrepancies. As for the lunar conjunction, the conjunction day is the same as the first day of a month. Since we use the calendar issued at that time, it is not necessary to list the "calendrical conjunction" separately. In the preface of <i>Pocket Edition of 100-Year Chinese Calendar</i><sup><a href="#liu93">Liu93</a></sup>, it says that there is a typo in <i>Supplement to the Explanation of the Almanac Calculations</i>, causing a series of mistakes in the calendrical conjunctions in N<sub>1924</sub> and N<sub>1925</sub> in the calendar book <i>W&#224;nni&#225;nl&#236;</i> published in 1910. This typo was discovered by people preparing the official Chinese calendar for the Republic of China around 1924. I don't know why such serious discrepancies in calendrical conjunctions were not seen before the end of the Qing dynasty.</p>
    
<p>With the adoption of the <i>d&#237;nq&#236;</i> rule, problems relating to the leap months arise. The no zh&#333;ngq&#236; rule that has been used over 2000 years no longer works, because it is now possible to have a month without a major solar term in a regular su&#236; and more than one month without a major solar term in a leap su&#236;. This problem was already noticed by the almanac-reform committee in the late Ming dynasty. One committee member named L&#464; Ti&#257;nj&#299;ng (&#26446;&#22825;&#32147;) proposed a method to resolve the issue. If a solar term and conjunction occur on the same day, the traditional convention is that the solar term is considered to be in the month associated with the conjunction. L&#464; proposed that if the solar term occurred earlier than the conjunction, it should be considered to be in the preceding month even if they were on the same day. Only if the solar term occurred later than the conjunction would it to be considered to be in the month associated with the conjunction. This method would be able to handle almost all situations. In <span class="nowrap">N<sub>1645</sub></span>, the <i>Sh&#237;xi&#224;n Calendar</i> listed the date of the major solar term Z6 to be on the first day in leap month 6, breaking the traditional rule that a leap month must not contain any major solar term. W&#257;ng Yu&#275;zh&#275;n (&#27754;&#26352;&#26984;), a Chinese mathematician in the 19th century, explained that even though the solar term Z6 and the lunar conjunction associated with the month occurred on the same day, Z6 occurred earlier in the day than the lunar conjunction and was counted as a major solar term of the previous month. As a result, leap month 6 did not contain any major solar term. This was exactly the idea proposed by L&#464;. However, this rule was only used in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>1645</sub></span>. It was never used again after this year. Historical document indicates that the rule that was used later was to place a leap month in the first month that did not contain a major solar term after the winter solstice in a leap su&#236;. This is the origin of Rule 5 stated in the <a href="rules.html#rules">Chinese calendar rules page</a>. This rule was made by Schall von Bell. The reason why L&#464;'s rule was not adopted was probably because the traditional no zh&#333;ngq&#236; rule could handle most leap months. Having a month without a major solar term in a regular su&#236; or more than one month without a major solar term in a leap su&#236; is very rare, and these situations can be resolved by slightly modifying the no zh&#333;ngq&#236; rule. Using L&#464;'s rule will result in the same situation as in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>1645</sub></span>: a leap month that can be handled by the no zh&#333;ngq&#236; rule is modified to a leap month that violates tradition. Adopting the <i>d&#237;nq&#236;</i> rule already generated controversies. Had L&#464;'s rule been used, even more controversies would surely have been generated.</p>

<h2 class="subsec" id="imperial">Middle Han to Ming Period (104 B.C. &ndash; 1644 A.D.)</h2>
    
<p>There were more than 40 different systems developed to calculate the calendars in this period spanning more than 1700 years. All of these methods are quite different from the modern method. Looking into these methods one by one and then checking the resulting calculations would take too much time. Instead, I use the calendar data in the book <i>3500 Calendars and Astronomical Phenomena</i><sup><a href="#Zhang1997">Zhang97</a></sup> in this period. When checking the data in the book, I found more than 40 mistakes in the book. Most of these mistakes have been pointed out by X&#468; Ji&#224;nw&#283;i (&#35377;&#21133;&#20553;), creator of the software Sh&#242;ux&#299;ng Almanac (<a href="http://www.nongli.net/sxwnl/" target="_blank">&#23551;&#26143;&#22825;&#25991;&#21382;</a>). All of the errors discovered so far are compiled on <a href="3500Calendars_errors.html">this page</a> for those who can read Chinese.</p>
    
<p>Starting on the first day of month 5 in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-103</sub></span>, I use the calendar data from <i>3500 Calendars and Astronomical Phenomena</i>. The calendar data in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-103</sub></span> before month 5 are calculated using the reconstruction method described in the next section.</p>
    
<p>In this period (104 B.C. &ndash; 1644 A.D.), there are a few things worth mentioning. The first thing is that there were four short periods in which the beginning of a year was changed to other months:</p>
    
<ul>
<li>The Xin dynasty was established in 9 A.D. The ch&#466;u month (present day month 12) was designated as the first month of a year; the y&#237;n month (present day month 1) became month 2 and so on. The Chinese month numbers were shifted by one. As a result, <span class="nowrap">N<sub>8</sub></span> had only 11 months. When the Xin dynasty was overthrown in 23 A.D., the month numbers were switched back with month 1 being the y&#237;n month again in the following year. As a result, <span class="nowrap">N<sub>23</sub></span> had 13 months, where month 12 appeared twice (z&#464; month and ch&#466;u month).</li>
    
<li>In 237 A.D., emperor Mingdi of the Wei dynasty (&#39759;&#26126;&#24093;) declared that the ch&#466;u month (present day month 12) would be the first month of a year; the y&#237;n month (present day month 1) became month 2 and so on. The Chinese month numbers were shifted by one. The new system was imposed after month 2 in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>237</sub></span>, in which month 4 was followed by month 2. When the emperor died in 239 A.D., the month numbers were switched back with month 1 being the y&#237;n month again in the following year. As a result, <span class="nowrap">N<sub>239</sub></span> had 13 months, where month 12 appeared twice (z&#464; month and ch&#466;u month). In addition, month 12 in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>236</sub></span> had only 28 days as a new version of the Chinese calendar was adopted.</li>
    
<li>In December 689, Empress Consort Wu (&#27494;&#21063;&#22825;) designated the z&#464; month (month 11) as the first month of a year. However, the month numbers did not change. The z&#464; month was named Zheng, which is usually referred to month 1; ch&#466;u month was stilled called month 12; y&#237;n month was month 1 and so on. On this website the Zheng month is still labelled as month 11. The first month of a year was changed back to month 1 in February 701. <span class="nowrap">N<sub>689</sub></span> only had 11 months (one leap month), whereas <span class="nowrap">N<sub>700</sub></span> had 15 months (one leap month).</li>
    
<li>In December 761, emperor Suzong of the Tang dynasty (&#21776;&#32901;&#23447;) designated the z&#464; month (present day month 11) as the first month of a year; the ch&#466;u month (present day month 12) became month 2; the y&#237;n month (present day month 1) became month 3 and so on. The Chinese month numbers were shifted by two. As a result, <span class="nowrap">N<sub>761</sub></span> had only 10 months. The month numbers ware switched back to the old system in April 762. <span class="nowrap">N<sub>762</sub></span> had 14 months, with two month 4s (m&#462;o month and s&#236; month) and two month 5s (ch&#233;n month and w&#468; month).</li>
</ul>
    
    <p style="text-align:center;">**************************</p>
<p>Between 104 B.C. and 1644 A.D., there were periods when China was divided into many states. Each state issued its own calendar and these calendars were not exactly the same. <span style='text-decoration:line-through'>This website does not provide all the calendar data issued by the governments, but only adopts the calendars shown in the main texts of <i>3500 Calendars and Astronomical Phenomena</i>. In particular, calendars issued by the Wei dynasty and Jin dynasty are shown in the period 220&ndash;419; calendars issued by the Song, Qi, Liang, and Chen dynasties are shown in the period 420&ndash;589; calendars issued by the Liang, Tang, Jin, Han, and Zhou dynasties are shown in 907&ndash;960; calendars issued by the Song dynasty are shown in 961&ndash;1279. <i>3500 Calendars and Astronomical Phenomena</i> contains tables in the appendices listing the differences between calendars issued by other governments in those periods, but I don't plan on adding these data anytime soon. For those who can read Chinese, this <a href="https://sinocal.sinica.edu.tw/" target="_bklank">Chinese-Western calendar conversion website</a> created by Academia Sinica in Taiwan has data of calendars issued by other governments in those periods.</span></p>
    
<p>(<span style='color:#b233ff;'>New addition in late June, 2019</span>) I recently studied briefly about 20 of the ancient almanacs that were used for calendar computation, and was able to reproduce the Chinese calendars before 665, in 822-892 and in 1281-1644. My calendar data before 619 almost completely match the data in <i>3500 Calendars and Astronomical Phenomena</i>, whereas the majority of my data in 619-665, 822-892 and 1281-1644 match the data in the book. With these newly created computer programs, I was in a position to reproduce the calendars in the periods when China was divided.</p>
    
<p>Appendices 2-4 in <i>3500 Calendars and Astronomical Phenomena</i> contain tables comparing the calendar differences between different states in the Three Kingdoms period (223-280), Southern and Northern dynasties period (384-589) and the period between 947 and 1279. The preface of the book says that the data in the appendices are based on the book 《歷代長術輯要》(roughly translated to <i>Compilation of Historical Calendars</i>) by W&#257;ng Yu&#275;zh&#275;n (汪曰楨). For the convenience of comparison of my computation and the data in the book, I wrote a code to create tables for calendar differences in the <a href='ThreeKingdoms_calendars.html'>Three Kingdoms period (223-280)</a> and <a href='NorthSouth_calendars.html'>Northern and Southern dynasties period (384-589)</a> in the same form as the tables in Appendices 2-3 of the book. I found that there were only a few mismatches between my computation and the data in the book. Three of the mismatches are also present between the book's main text and the appendices! My data agree with the main text. Since I am not an expert in Chinese history, I can't determine which of them are correct. I therefore only mention these discrepancies. For the other discrepancies, I compared the data with the calendar data on the <a href="https://sinocal.sinica.edu.tw/" target="_bklank">Chinese-Western calendar conversion website</a> created by Academia Sinica in Taiwan, as well as the data in the book <i>Compilation of Historical Calendars</i>. (Sadly, the Chinese-Western calendar conversion website was closed on July 1, 2019.) I found that in 4 of the mismatches, the book's data agree with the other two sources and therefore I modified my data. However, in 3 of the remaining mismatches my data agree with the other two sources and so I don't use the book's data.</p>
    
<p>I also intended to calculate the calendars in 947-1279 but encountered a difficulty. Four almanacs were used in the dynasties in the North for calendar computation in 947-1279. At the beginning of the Liao (a.k.a Khitan) dynasty, Ti&#225;oyu&#225;n almanac was used until 994 when it was replaced by the D&#224;m&#237;ng almanac. This D&#224;m&#237;ng almanac was created by Ji&#462; J&#249;n (賈俊), which was different from the D&#224;m&#237;ng almanac created by Z&#468; Ch&#333;ngzh&#299; (祖沖之) several hundred years earlier. After the Jin dynasty (established by the Jurchen people) replaced Liao in 1125, a new calendar based on another D&#224;m&#237;ng almanac (created by Y&#225;ng J&#237; 楊級) was adopted in 1137. The almanac was found to be inaccurate in predicting several eclipses and so was revised by Zh&#224;o Zh&#299;w&#275;i (趙知微) in 1182 and was in use even after the Mongols conquered Jin in 1234. Ti&#225;oyu&#225;n almanac and Ji&#462;'s D&#224;m&#237;ng almanac were not preserved. When the 14th century historians wrote the chapters on almanacs in the book <i>History of Liao</i>, they didn't have the information on Ji&#462;'s D&#224;m&#237;ng almanac and thought that it was the same as Z&#468; Ch&#333;ngzh&#299;'s D&#224;m&#237;ng almanac. They then copied the description of Z&#468;'s D&#224;m&#237;ng almanac from an earlier historical record! To deal with the missing almanacs, W&#257;ng reconstructed the calendars using almanacs that he thought were similar to the missing ones. In particular, he replaced Ti&#225;oyu&#225;n almanac by Xu&#257;nm&#237;ng almanac, Ji&#462;'s D&#224;m&#237;ng almanac by Zh&#224;o Zh&#299;w&#275;i's revised D&#224;m&#237;ng almanac and then adjusted the leap months to be consistent with the records in <i>History of Liao</i>. Looking at the calendar difference table in Appendix 4 of <i>3500 Calendars and Astronomical Phenomena</i>, I see that the calendar differences between the south and north dynasties are not much. Instead of following W&#257;ng's "calculate-and-correct" approach to reconstruct the calendars in the north states, it is much simpler to just use Appendix 4's calendar difference data directly to reconstruct the calendars in the north states from the calendars in the south state. The resulting JavaScript code and the JSON data storing the calendar differences turn out to be much shorter than the code that generates the calendars in 221-280 and 384-589. This approach is equivalent to using the almanacs in the south state to calculate calendars and then make corrections. The complicated calculation is actually hidden in the calendar computation using the almanacs in the south state. Appendix 4 of <i>3500 Calendars and Astronomical Phenomena</i> has no information on the calendrical solar terms, so I need to find a way to fill in the data for the <a href='index.html'>calendar page</a>. The approach is described briefly at the bottom of the <a href='LiaoJinYuan_calendars.html'>calendar differences in 947-1279 page</a>.</p>
    
<p>Combined the algorithms of calendar calculation in these periods, I added calendars in several additional dynasties in 221-280, 384-589, and 947-1279 in the <a href='index.html'>calendar page</a>. When a Western year in those periods is entered, there will be buttons appearing on the page for selecting different dynasties. Conversion tables for these additional dynasties are also added in the <a href='table.html'>conversion table page</a>.</p>
    <p style="text-align:center;">**************************</p>
    
<p>While the Chinese calendar was modified many times in this period, the Western calendar was quite stable. There was one major reform in 1582: the Gregorian calendar reform. Before 1582, the Western calendar was based on the Julian calendar, which was a solar calendar. Years that were divisible by 4 (leap years) had 366 days and the others had 365 days. The average length of a year in the Julian calendar is 365.25, which is 0.0078 days longer than the tropical year. The Gregorian calendar reform was motivated by the controversies over the date of Easter. The date of Easter was established by the First Council of Nicaea in 325 to be the Sunday following the full moon that follows the vernal (March) equinox. However, "full moon" and "vernal equinox" were not defined by astronomy. The full moon was defined to be the 14th day of a luni-solar calendar. Vernal equinox was fixed on March 21, which was the approximate date of the equinox in 325 in the Julian calendar. Since the average year of the Julian calendar is slightly longer than the tropical year, the date of vernal equinox drifted earlier and earlier in the Julian calendar. By the late 16th century, the vernal equinox drifted to March 11, causing controversies over the date of Easter calculation and calling for a calendar reform. In 1582, Pope Gregory XIII carried out the calendar reform. The date following Oct. 4, 1582 was Oct. 15, 1582. Ten days were skipped in order to restore the vernal equinox back to March 21. To prevent the drift of the vernal equinox in the calendar, three leap years are subtracted in every 400 years. This is accomplished by the rule that years that are divisible by 4 but not 100 (e.g. 2016) are leap years; years that are divisible by 100 but not 400 (e.g. 1900) are not leap years and years that are divisible by 400 (e.g. 2000) are leap years. This is the Gregorian calendar we are using today. The average length of a year is 365.2425 days, close to the tropical year 365.2422 days. It takes 3300 years for the error to accumulate to one day. Although not every country in the West adopted the Gregorian calendar in 1582, the convention is still to switch to the Gregorian calendar on Oct. 15, 1582.</p>
    
<p>The Julian calendar was proposed by Julius Caesar, the dictator of the Roman Republic. Caesar adopted the calendar system designed by the astronomer Sosigenes of Alexandria. The calendar took effect on Jan. 1, 45 B.C. Caesar was soon assassinated in 44 B.C. and the leap years were not implemented correctly in the first 36 years. A leap day was inserted every three years instead of every four years. When the error was realized in 8 B.C., three additional leap days had been added. It was then decided to skip three leap years in the following 12 years and the system was operated as Caesar intended after 4 A.D. I follow the usual convention of not taking into account the leap-year error of the Julian calendar and simply extending the Julian calendar backwards to dates before 8 A.D. This is known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proleptic_Julian_calendar" target="_blank">proleptic Julian calendar</a>.</p>
    
<br />
<h2 class="subsec" id="qinhan">Qin and Early Han Period (221 B.C. &ndash; 104 B.C.)</h2>
    
<p>The calendars used between 221 B.C. and 104 B.C. were modified versions of the Zhuanxu calendar, one of the old calendars used in the third century B.C. in the state of Qin. The first month was the h&#224;i month (present-day month 10). However, it was still called month 10 instead of month 1. The numerical order of the months in a year was 10, 11, 12, 1, 2, ..., 9. The intercalary month was placed at the end of a year, called post month 9 (&#24460;&#20061;&#26376;). There was a major calendar reform in 104 B.C., where the first month of a year was changed to month 1 and the intercalary month was placed in the month that did not contain a major solar term. The Chinese year in 104 B.C. had 15 Chinese months as a result of the change. The calendars in this period are reconstructed according to the description in the article by L&#464; Zh&#333;ngl&#237;n (&#26446;&#24544;&#26519;) in 2012<sup><a href="#Li2012">Li</a></sup>. The computation method is explained on <a href="QinHanCalendars.html">this page</a>.</p>
    
<p>Even though the reconstruction method is claimed to be valid for calendar from <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-245</sub></span> to month 5 in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-103</sub></span>, our <a href="index.html">calendar page</a> uses this method from 221 B.C. to month 4 in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-103</sub></span> and our <a href="table.html">calendar table page</a> uses this method from <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-220</sub></span> to month 4 in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-103</sub></span> (the <a href="index.html">calendar page</a> is mainly based on the Western calendar and the <a href="table.html">calendar table page</a> is mainly based on the Chinese calendar). Starting in month 5 in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-103</sub></span>, both pages use the data from the book <i>3500 Years of Calendars and Astronomical Phenomena</i><sup><a href="#Zhang1997">Zhang97</a></sup>, which shows calendar data based on the T&#224;ich&#363; almanac (&#22826;&#21021;&#26310;) beginning in month 1 in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-103</sub></span><sup><a href="#fn2">fn2</a></sup>. In <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-103</sub></span>, month 3 had 29 days and month 4 should have had 30 days according to the reconstructed calendar. However, when the new calendar was used in month 5, the conjunction day moved one day earlier, turning month 4 into a short month. Month 5 was a short month in the new calendar. As a result, months 3, 4, 5 in <span class="nowrap">N<sub>-103</sub></span> all had 29 days. This is impossible for any calendar based on the <i>p&#237;ngshu&#242;</i> rule (i.e. based on the mean motion of the Moon and Sun), and could only occur when switching to a new calendar. If the switch is changed to month 6, month 5 will have 28 days, which is also impossible under normal circumstances.</p>
    
<br />
<h2 class="subsec" id="warring">Warring States Period (480 B.C. &ndash; 222 B.C.)</h2>
    
<p>In the Warring States period, China was divided into many states. Each state used its own calendar. It was believed that there were six versions of calendars used by the states at that time. They are collectively called g&#468;li&#249;l&#236; (&#21476;&#20845;&#26310;) or ancient six calendars. These six calendars were Zhou, Lu, Huangdi, Yin, Xia and Zhuanxu. They were all based on a similar algorithm. However, the first month of a year was not the same. The epoch (used to specify the initial data for the lunar conjunction and winter solstice) used in each calendar was also different. The calendars in g&#468;li&#249;l&#236; on this website are reconstructed based on the information in Section 3.6 of the book <i>Zh&#333;ng Gu&#243; G&#468; D&#224;i L&#236; F&#462;</i> (&#12298;&#20013;&#22269;&#21476;&#20195;&#21382;&#27861;&#12299; or <i>Ancient Chinese Calendars and Almanacs</i>)<sup><a href="#ZCBH2008">ZCBH</a></sup>. The computation method is explained in the <a href="guliuli.html">ancient six calendars page</a>.</p>
    
<p>The Xia calendar had two versions, which used slightly difference epoch  in the calendar calculation. The version shown in the Spring and Autumn period (722 B.C. &ndash; 481 B.C.) is different from the one used in the Warring States period (480 B.C. &ndash; 222 B.C.): the epoch used in the Spring and Autumn period was the time when the lunar conjunction and Z1 were assumed to occur at midnight, whereas the epoch used in the Warring States period was the time when the lunar conjunction and winter solstice were assumed to occur at midnight.</p>
    
<p>Scholars have not come to a consensus on the position of the intercalary month. I assume that it was placed at the end of a year, and was simply called the leap month. Some people think that leap month was placed in the month without any major solar term. Months without a major solar term are also indicated for reference. The Zhuanxu calendar is special. The first month of the Zhuanxu calendar was the h&#224;i month (present day month 10), but it was called month 10. The subsequent months were named month 11, month 12, month 1, ..., month 9. The leap month was placed at the end of a year and was called post month 9 (&#24460;&#20061;&#26376;).</p>
    
<p>It is believed that the ancient six calendars were developed in the Warring States period, but none of them is preserved today. We can now only learn about them from literature hundreds of years later. The reliability of the information remains uncertain to this date.</p>
    
<br />
<h2 class="subsec" id="spring">Spring and Autumn Period (722 B.C. &ndash; 481 B.C.)</h2>
    
<p>In the Spring and Autumn period, China was divided into many states. Each state used its own calendar. In this period, we only have fragmented information about the calendar used by the Lu state from the chronicle <i>Chunqiu</i> revised by Confucius. This calendar is called Chunqiu here. The Chunqiu calendar on our website is reconstructed based on the information in Section 3.5 of the book <i>Ancient Chinese Calendars and Almanacs</i><sup><a href="#ZCBH2008">ZCBH</a></sup>. The computation method is explained on the <a href="chunqiu.html">Chunqiu Calendar page</a>.</p>
    
<p>The Chunqiu calendar did not have a fixed rule for placing the intercalary months. The result was that the first month of a year varied between the h&#224;i month (present day month 10) and y&#237;n month (present day month 1). The first month often coincided with the ch&#466;u month (present day month 12) in the early years, and often coincided with the z&#464; month (present day month 11) in the later years. Scholars have not come to a consensus on the position of the intercalary month. I assume that it was placed at the end of a year, and was simply called the leap month. The Chunqiu calendar did not have an algorithm to compute the winter solstice (or any other solar terms). The winter solstice at the time was determined by observation. Thus, there were no calendrical solar terms.</p>
    
<p>In addition to the Chunqiu calendar, three calendars Zhou, Yin and Xia (three of the <i>g&#468;li&#249;l&#236;</i> or <i>ancient six calendars</i>) are also provided for reference, although it is believed that they were developed in a later period. As mentioned in the previous section, the Xia calendar had two versions. The epoch used in the Spring and Autumn period was the time when the lunar conjunction and Z1 were assumed to occur at midnight.</p>
