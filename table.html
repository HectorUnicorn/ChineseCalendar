<h1>Chinese Calendar &ndash; Gregorian Calendar Conversion Table</h1>

<p>The following table lists the Gregorian dates MM-DD of the first day of each month in the Chinese calendar for the years 1901&ndash;2200. MM indicates the Gregorian month and DD indicates the Gregorian date. When MM is 13, it means January in the following Gregorian year. The &mdash; in the leap month column means that there is no leap month in that Chinese year. Otherwise, it has the form X: MM-DD. X indicates the month number before the leap month; MM-DD indicates the Gregorian date of the first day in the leap month. The last column lists the total number of days in the Chinese year.</p>
    
<p>The first day of a month in the Chinese calendar is determined by the day on which the lunar conjunction (i.e. new moon) falls. The exact time (in UTC+8) of a lunar conjunction cannot be determined accurately far in the future. If a lunar conjunction occurs near the midnight, the predicted first day of a month may be off by one day. These cases occur on September 29, 2057; September 4, 2089; August 7, 2097; September 28, 2133; October 17, 2172 and May 12, 2192. They are indicated by a star and in red color.</p>
    
<p>The Chinese calendar data on this website are computed using the method described <a href="rules.html#calculation">here</a>.</p>
