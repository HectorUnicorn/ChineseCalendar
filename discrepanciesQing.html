Thus, the content was removed on January 23, 2022.</p><p>In December 20220, I created a <a href="http://ytliu.epizy.com/Shixian" target="_blank">web-based platform</a> to calculate the solar and lunar positions as well as the times of solar terms and moon phases according to the Shixian system. It may be useful for people interested in the study of the history of Chinese astronomy in the Qing dynasty.</p><p>A detailed comparison of the positions of the Sun and Moon, as well as the times of moon phases and solar terms, between the Shixian system and modern high-accuracy ephemerides can be found in Section 6 of <a href="http://ytliu.epizy.com/Shixian/Shixian_summary.pdf" target="_blank">this pdf document</a>.</p><br><br></div></body></html>
